# About this Project
By using the models we have built in the previous articles, we can easily segment the customers and predict their lifetime value (LTV) for targeting purposes. As a side note, we also know what will be our sales numbers. But how we can increase our sales? This notebook show if we do a discount today, how many incremental transactions should we expect.

## Prerequisites
